# This CMake file specifies compiler definitions required
# and the log library to bind for either implementations of
# c++11 and boost.
# It can be included by other projects which depend on this library.
# 
# Defines the following cmake variables:
#   ARCH_DEFINITIONS_BOOST: the compile definitions you need to use for your targets
#   ARCH_DEFINITIONS_STD: the compile definitions you need to use for your targets
#   ARCH_LOG_LIBRARY_BOOST: the library to bind for the logger
#   ARCH_LOG_LIBRARY_STD: the library to bind for the logger
#
# If the variables USE_BOOST_ARCH or USE_STD_ARCH ar
# set BEFORE this file is included, the compiler directives are added
# with add_definitions for either boost or c++11, and the
# library to use is going to be defined in ARCH_LOG_LIBRARY.

# If add_definitions is called, ALL depending projects which
# use architecture_binding (even through indirect dependencies
# or "grandparents") will use the definitions.
# For C++11 it is required to switch off the error while it's still
# experimental.
